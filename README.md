Artifical Intelligence Finance Trading 


## Motivation 
* Algorithms are important in trading
* Relates to physics where in the finance world, time scales of nanoseconds/speed of light are important


## Finance World
Algorithmic trading 

* Focus on High Frequency Trading
  1) Market makers, set price
  2) **Statistical arbitrage, guess price** (three examples below)

* Examples
  * Ex.1 Pair Trading Algorithms
    * Time series of one stock
    * Convert to binary 
    * Look for correlations and diverges (delta)
    * If diverges, makes trade and wins 

  * Ex.2 Moving Large Volume Stocks 
    * Break up large stock ($200million)
    * Iceberging 

  * Ex.3 Predator-Prey Algorithms 
    * Ping and sharks
    * Reverse engineer stealth algorithms, attack and win
    * Put noise out there to confuse the other algorithms

* Ultra-Fast Black Swan
  * When you have species that all look the same in the ecosystem, the system crashes
