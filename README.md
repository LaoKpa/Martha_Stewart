AI finance trading 


## Motivation 
Algorithms are important in trading - relates to physics and the speed of light where in finance world time-scales where nanoseconds are important 


## Finance World
Algorithmic trading 
* focus on high frequency trading
  1) market makers, set price
  2) statistical arbitrage, guess price
* ex pair trading algorithms(from 2)
  time series of one stock
  convert to binary 
  look for correlations and diverges (delta)
  if diverges, makes trade and wins 
* ex moving large volume stocks 
  break up large stock ($200million)
  iceberging 
* ex predator-prey algorithms 
  ping and sharks
  reverse engineer stealth algorithms, attack and win
  put noise out there to confuse the other algorithms
* ultra-fast black swan
  when you have species that all look the same in the ecosystem - system crashes
