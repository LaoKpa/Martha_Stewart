Artifical Intelligence Finance Trading 


## Motivation 
* Algorithms are important in trading
* Relates to physics where in the finance world, time scales of nanoseconds/speed of light are important


## Finance World
Algorithmic trading 

* Focus on High Frequency Trading
  1) Market makers, set price
  2) **Statistical arbitrage, guess price** (three examples below)

* Examples
  * Ex.1 Pair Trading Algorithms
    * Time series of one stock
    * Convert to binary 
    * Look for correlations and diverges (delta)
    * If diverges, makes trade and wins 

  * Ex.2 Moving Large Volume Stocks 
    * Break up large stock ($200million)
    * Iceberging 

  * Ex.3 Predator-Prey Algorithms 
    * Ping and sharks
    * Reverse engineer stealth algorithms, attack and win
    * Put noise out there to confuse the other algorithms

* Ultra-Fast Black Swan
  * When you have species that all look the same in the ecosystem, the system crashes


## Technical

**Python Data Science Toolkit**

* Python Programming Language
  * Beautiful
  * Statistical computing language
  
* Pandas Library
  * Data analysis library 
  * Created by Wes McKinney working at hedgefund AQR Capital Management
  
* Financial Data
  * Spreedsheet datasets with rows and columns
  * Finance problems more about manipulating data than math
  * Quality data is far more important than fancy analysis
  
* Other Tools: Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib
* Alternatives: Excel or R


**Udacity course "Machine Learning for Trading” from Georgia Tech (CS 7646)**

* Implementing ML based trading strateies from info gathering to market orders
* Focus on how to apply probalistic ML approachhes to trading decisions
* Statistical approaches - linear regression, KNN, regression tree 
* Data structures used for algorithmc trading 
* Build a stock trading software system that uses current daily data
* Build software to access live equity daat, assess it, and make trading decisions
